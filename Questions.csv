Can you explain the water cycle?,"The water cycle is a continuous process through which water moves on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It starts with evaporation, where the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning it into water vapor. This vapor rises into the atmosphere and cools down to form clouds in a process called condensation. When the clouds become heavy, precipitation occurs in the form of rain, snow, or hail. The water then flows back into rivers, lakes, and oceans through runoff or seeps into the ground to replenish groundwater, completing the cycle."
